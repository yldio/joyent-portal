  # Allows you to provision an instance.
  #
  # If you do not specify a name, CloudAPI will generate a random one for you. If you have enabled Triton CNS on your account, this name will also be used in DNS to refer to the new instance (and must therefore consist of DNS-safe characters only).
  #
  # Your instance will initially be not available for login (Triton must provision and boot it); you can poll [GetMachine](https://apidocs.joyent.com/cloudapi/#GetMachine) for its status. When the `state` field is equal to `running`, you can log in. If the instance is a `brand` other than `kvm`, you can usually use any of the SSH keys managed under the [keys section](https://apidocs.joyent.com/cloudapi/#keys) of CloudAPI to login as any POSIX user on the OS. You can add/remove keys over time, and the instance will automatically work with that set.
  #
  # If the the instance has a brand `kvm`, and of a UNIX-derived OS (e.g. Linux), you must have keys uploaded before provisioning; that entire set of keys will be written out to `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` in the new instance, and you can SSH in using one of those keys. Changing the keys over time under your account will not affect a running hardware virtual machine in any way; those keys are statically written at provisioning-time only, and you will need to manually manage them on the instance itself.
  #
  # If the image you create an instance from is set to generate passwords for you, the username/password pairs will be returned in the metadata response as a nested object, like so:
  #
  # ```json
  # "metadata": {
  #   "credentials": {
  #     "root": "s8v9kuht5e",
  #     "admin": "mf4bteqhpy"
  #   }
  # }
  # ```
  #
  # You cannot overwrite the `credentials` key in CloudAPI.
  #
  # More generally, the metadata keys can be set either at the time of instance creation, or after the fact. You must either pass in plain-string values, or a JSON-encoded string. On metadata retrieval, you will get a JSON object back.
  #
  # Networks can be specified using the networks attribute. If it is absent from the input, the instance will default to attaching to one externally-accessible network (it will have one public IP), and one internally-accessible network from the datacenter network pools. It is possible to have an instance attached to only an internal network, or both public and internal, or just external.
  #
  # Be aware that CreateMachine does not return IP addresses or networks. To obtain the IP addresses and networks of a newly-provisioned instance, poll [GetMachine](https://apidocs.joyent.com/cloudapi/#GetMachine) until the instance state is `running`.
  #
  # Typically, Triton will allocate the new instance somewhere reasonable within the cloud. See [affinity rules](https://apidocs.joyent.com/cloudapi/#affinity-rules) below for options on controlling server placement of new instances.
  #
  # When Triton CNS is enabled, the DNS search domain of the new VM will be automatically set to the suffix of the "instance" record that is created for that VM. For example, if the full CNS name of the new VM would be "foo.inst.35ad1ec4-2eab-11e6-ac02-8f56c66976a1.us-west-1.triton.zone", its automatic DNS search path would include "inst.35ad1ec4-2eab-11e6-ac02-8f56c66976a1.us-west-1.triton.zone". This can be changed later within the instance, if desired.
